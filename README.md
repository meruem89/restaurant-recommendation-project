# Restaurant Recommendation System

## Project Overview

A machine learning system that predicts which restaurants customers are most likely to order from, using collaborative filtering and content-based approaches.

## Dataset

- **Customers**: 34,674+ customer profiles with demographics
- **Orders**: 125,000+ order history records with ratings
- **Vendors**: 100 restaurant profiles with features
- **Locations**: Customer location data with coordinates

## Model Architecture

- **Collaborative Filtering**: Finds similar customers and recommends based on their preferences
- **Content-Based Filtering**: Recommends similar restaurants based on features
- **Hybrid Approach**: Combines both methods for optimal accuracy

## Performance

- **Recommendation Rate**: ~20%
- **Coverage**: 100% of test customers and vendors
- **Processing Time**: <5 minutes for full prediction generation
